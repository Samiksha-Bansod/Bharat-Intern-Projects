TASK TO PERFORM

Note : Select a dataset for your project from
Kaggle or choose one that suits your needs.

1. SMS Classifier :
Develop a text classification model to
classify SMS as either spam or non-spam
using data science techniques in Python.

2. Titanic Classification :
Build a predictive model to determine the
likelihood of survival for passengers on
the Titanic using data science techniques
in Python.

3. Cat and Dog Image Classifier :
Develop an image classification model to
distinguish between images of cats and dogs
using data science techniques in Python.

We are required to accomplish a MINIMUM of 2 TASKS
from the list of assigned tasks provided within your
internship program.

So, I chose:- 2. Titanic classifier and 3. Cat and Dog Image Classifier.


## Titanic Classification :
Build a predictive model to determine the likelihood of survival for passengers on the Titanic using data science techniques in Python.
About the Dataset
Description:
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone on board, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.

In this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).

Acknowledgements:
This dataset has been referred from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data.

Objective:
Understand the Dataset & cleanup (if required). Build a strong classification model to predict whether the passenger survives or not.

Columns Information
1) Passenger ID - To identify unique passengers
2) Survived - If they survived or not (0 = Dead 1 = Alive)
3) P Class - The class passengers travelled in
4) Name - Passenger Name
5) Sex - Gender of Passenger
6) Age - Age of passenger
7) SibSp - Number of siblings or spouse
8) Parch - Parent or child
9) Ticket - Ticket number
10) Fare - Amount paid for the ticket
11) Cabin - Cabin of residence
12) Embarked - Point of embarkment (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton)
